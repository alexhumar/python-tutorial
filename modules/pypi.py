# pypi stands for Python Project index and is a "repository" of Python packaged made by the community that we can
# install and use.
# Any package can be installed by executing the following command:
# pip install [package_name]. That command doesn't work. I had to use: python3.8 -m pip install openpyxl
# in a terminal, within the python project root directory
# Packages installed by pip will be places in External Libraries -> Python 3.X -> site-packages
